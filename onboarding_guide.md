## Part II: Technical Onboarding

### Workstation Setup

Setting up a robust workstation is essential for a smooth start. Follow these recommendations:

#### Hardware and Operating System

- **Hardware:**  
  - A modern multi-core processor (Intel i5/Ryzen 5 or better).  
  - Minimum 16GB RAM (32GB recommended for heavy computational tasks).  
  - SSD storage for faster file access.  
  - Dual-monitor setup is beneficial for coding and data visualization.
- **Operating System:**  
  - Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) or macOS is recommended for ease of using scientific libraries.  
  - Windows users should consider using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a virtual machine.

#### Software and Tools

- **Text Editors/IDEs:**  
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), or similar.
- **Version Control:**  
  - Install Git and configure it with your team’s repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
- **Terminal Tools:**  
  - Familiarize yourself with command-line utilities (bash, zsh, etc.).
- **Containerization (Optional):**  
  - Tools like Docker may be used for project portability and environment reproducibility.

### Project Setup and Initialization

A reproducible computational project is key to collaborative research. Follow these steps to set up your project:

#### Repository Setup

```bash
git clone https://yourteam.repo.url/project.git
cd project
```

#### Environment Management with Conda (or pip)

Using isolated environments ensures reproducibility. Here’s how to set up a conda environment:

1. **Install Miniconda/Anaconda:**  
   - Follow instructions at [conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. **Create a New Environment:**  
   - Use an environment YAML file for fast setups and consistency across the team.

#### Example Conda Environment YAML File

```yaml
name: project_env
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - jupyterlab
  - ipykernel
  - scikit-learn
  - pip
  - pip:
      - some-additional-package
```

**Instructions:**

```bash
# Creating the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activating the environment
conda activate project_env

# Updating the environment
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

For pip users, maintain a `requirements.txt` file with a similar list of packages, and install using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Project Structure Recommendations

Organize your computational project with a clear folder structure:
```
project/
│
├── data/               # Raw and processed data
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── src/                # Source code and scripts
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── module.py
├── environment.yml     # Conda environment specification
├── requirements.txt    # Alternative pip environment specification
├── README.md           # Project overview and setup instructions
└── docs/               # Documentation and additional resources
```

### Best Practices in Coding and Reproducibility

Ensuring high-quality, reproducible, and maintainable code is a fundamental principle of our team. Follow these guidelines:

#### **Coding Standards**
- Follow **PEP 8** for Python or the relevant style guide for your programming language.
- Use **linters** such as `flake8` and auto-formatters like `black` to enforce consistency.
- Modularize code into functions and classes to improve readability and reusability.

#### **Documentation**
- Use **docstrings** for all functions and modules (e.g., Google-style or NumPy-style docstrings).
- Maintain a well-structured `README.md` for each project, explaining setup, dependencies, and usage.
- Keep an updated **CHANGELOG** to track project modifications.

#### **Version Control & Collaboration**
- Follow the **Git workflow** agreed upon by the team (e.g., `feature-branching`, `main-dev-release`).
- Write **descriptive commit messages**, referencing issue numbers where applicable.
- Always **review code** before merging (`pull requests` with mandatory approvals).

#### **Reproducibility**
- Use Conda or virtual environments to manage dependencies.
- Prefer **exact versions** for dependencies when publishing environments (`requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`).
- Document all **random seeds** used in simulations or machine learning models to ensure consistency.

#### **Testing**
- Write **unit tests** for all functions using `pytest` or `unittest`.
- Use **continuous integration (CI)** tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate testing.
- Ensure at least **80% test coverage** to maintain code reliability.


### Data Management

#### **Organizing Data**
- Store raw and processed data separately (`data/raw/` and `data/processed/`).
- Use clear and consistent file naming conventions (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_experiment-name.csv`).
- Maintain a `data/README.md` file describing dataset contents, formats, and sources.

#### **Data Version Control**
- Use **DVC (Data Version Control)** if working with large datasets.
- Track metadata and transformations to ensure reproducibility.
- Document all preprocessing steps in code or separate metadata files.

#### **Data Management Plan (DMP)**
Before starting a project, write a **Data Management Plan (DMP)** to ensure data integrity, reproducibility, and compliance with institutional or funding body requirements. The DMP should include:

- **Data Description:** Specify types of data collected, generated, or used, including formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, NetCDF) and expected volume.
- **Storage and Backup Strategy:** Define where data will be stored (local, cloud, institutional servers) and backup frequency.
- **Data Versioning:** Describe how changes to datasets will be tracked (e.g., DVC, structured versioning folders).
- **Metadata and Documentation:** Ensure structured metadata (e.g., Dublin Core, JSON Schema) is included to describe data contents, sources, and usage.
- **Data Sharing and Access:** Establish access control policies, licensing, and any embargo periods before public release.
- **Security and Compliance:** Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR for personal data) and ethical guidelines for sensitive data.
- **Archival and Long-Term Preservation:** Define how data will be archived post-project, including repositories (e.g., Zenodo, institutional archives).

Every project should have a documented **DMP** stored in the project repository (`docs/data_management_plan.md`) and reviewed periodically.
